  <blockquote cite="https://continentalcamera.com/what-is-a-dark-room-photography">
    <p>Darkroom photography is a process of handling and printing film or negatives (light-sensitive materials) in a room with 
    less light or no light at all.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>A Brief History:</h3>
  <blockquote cite="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art37447.asp">
    <p>In the early days of photographic processing, the simplest form was using a darkened room to develop the very first kind of processes,
    silvered copper plates and papers. The actual term "darkroom" wasn't established until around 1841, when new light sensitive processes were 
    introduced and where such a working space was preferable amonst professionals and enthusiasts.<br>As the years went on, different processes 
    that developed introduced new types of darkrooms; for instance, the wet-plate process required for images to be developed immediately and as a 
    result make shift darkroom tents were on hand, conversely, the dry plate process allowed images to developed at leisure resulting in a permanent 
    darkroom.<br>With the dry plate process, gave way to hand held cameras and roll film. The ease provided by these inventions enabled enthusiasts to set up
    their own darkrooms to process their own films and make their own black and white prints.<p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the late 1800s to the present, photography hobbyists of all kinds, amateurs and professionals, have been able build their own darkrooms due to the 
  availability of the processing equipment.</p>

  <h3>The Process:</h3>
  <p>A typical darkroom is equipped with enlargers, chemicals, and running water.</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkroom">
    <p>An <dfn>enlarger</dfn> is an optical apparatus that projects light through the image of a negative
    onto a base, finely controls the focus, intensity and duration of light exposure.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Running water is used wash excess chemicals off of the paper; these chemicals are listed below:</p>
